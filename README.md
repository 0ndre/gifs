# GIFs (and not GIFs)

Because some of 'em are gifs and some of 'em ain't.

## Submitting a new image
I'm going to be pretty selective about new images, but if it's high quality and doesn't have a huge watermark we'll make it happen.

Here's what you gotta do:

1. FORK THIS THANG
2. Add your gif into the `img/` directory. Be cool with your filename. Don't use something like `dj8a1lpof.gif`.
3. Add your gif to the `_data/gifs.yaml` file. The `title` _must_ be the same as your filename. Add some tags so it's easy to find with metadata.
4. Submit that pull request
5. Celebration time!
